    <h1>The How</h1>
  </div>
  <section>
   
      <p>In 2016, an unprecedented event happened: Western Australia’s coastline suffered a mass-bleaching, which means 80% of the coral became sick and vulnerable.</p>

<p>This matters because they could easily die off, jeopardizing ecosystems full of fish and invertebrate that need them for food and shelter.</p>

<p>The bleaching impacts local communities, such as the fishing industry, which affects food supplies and income. The tourism industry also takes a hit, as people stop coming when the coral’s brilliant colors are gone.</p>

				<h2 class = "highlight-qt"> "More than 90% of the world's coral reefs will die by 2050" &ndash;Independent</h2>
    
			<p>Climate change has caused ocean temperatures to rise across the world, leading coral reefs on coast after coast to die. From El Niño in the Atlantic to a <a href = "http://voices.nationalgeographic.org/2015/10/29/global-coral-bleaching-event-puts-reefs-at-risk/"target = "blank">“warm blob”</a> in the Pacific Ocean&ndash;waters have become unusually warm, causing the coral to become stressed.</p>

<p>Once stressed, they bleach, which means they release the algae from their bodies and turn white. This state leaves them susceptible to sickness, starvation and death.</p>

<p>But what human activities lend to this trend? Pollution is a reason the waters are warming, as the atmosphere traps more greenhouse gases and contributes them to the ocean through the rain cycle.</p>

<p>In fact, temperatures are rising at twice the rate they did 50 years ago, according to <a href = "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-causes/" target = "blank">National Geographic.</a>Coral is extremely sensitive to temperature change; although they prefer warm waters, even a degree and a half difference can lead to stress.</p>

<p>Coral mining, overfishing and digging canals are some of the top reasons the ecosystem is changing as well. These activities kill and displace a disproportionate amount of organisms, changing the makeup and regulation of the ecosystem.</p>

      <p>While coral reefs across the world have experienced bleaching, two reefs have died in the Pacific: Japan’s Sekiseishoko Reef and Jarvis Island Reef. Seventy percent of Sekiseishoko Reef is completely dead, with another 30% white from bleaching.</p>

      <p>Jarvis Island began dying in 2015 and Sekiseishoko died earlier this year. 
</p>
      <p>The Great Barrier Reef, Australia’s famous spectacle&ndash;so magnificent that it can be seen from space&ndash;is starting to die. Miles of the reef’s northern coast completely died last year due to exceedingly hot waters.</p>
      <p>"Two-thirds of the [The Great Barrier Reef’s northern coast] were dying and are now dead"
&ndash;James Cook, Coral Reef Studies, University of Australia.
</p>
      <p>And its southern regions are blanching. The extent to which the reef has experienced damaged is grave; these effects, because of pollution and overheating of the water, were not expected for another 30 years.
</p>
      <p>Another unexpected finding occurred in 2017: scientists found an unusual reef at the mouth of the Amazon River. Although coral is rarely found where fresh and salt water mix and typically do not form in rivers, the Amazon Reef defies all rules. It boasts over 3,000 miles of coral, sponges and more. </p>
			
			<p> Unfortunately, it is no exception to bleaching and suffers from the effects of global warming. For a newly-found discovery, whose ecosystem is one-of-its-kind in the world, the death of this coral reef would be devastating. The Brazilian government had given <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/03/amazon-coral-reef-at-risk-of-damage-if-oil-spills-near-amazon-river" target = "blank">oil companies the rights to drill in that space,</a> before they discovered the reef. </p>
			
			<p> The government is still debating the fate of the space.</p>

  <h1> The Why </h1>
	      <p>But why should you care about this issue? Well, other people and groups have taken to social media to share their opinions as to why saving coral reefs is imperative. Here are a few hashtags formed to increase awareness and create change.  </p>

 <h2 class = "space2">Hashtags and The Reason Each One Matters</h2>
<ul>
	<li> <h2>&#35;Wettribe:</h2> <a href = "https://wettribe.com/the-cause/the-problem/" target = "blank"> Wettribe</a> is an organization that actively works to reverse contaminants in the water, that support global warming down the road. Their mission is to increase awareness about how this problem destroys ecosystems, impacts our health and provides organic and harm-free alternatives for clothing, food and products.</li>
		<li> <h2>&#35;ParisAgreement:</h2> <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/jan/06/-paris-agreement-biodiversity-coral-reefs-forests" target = "blank"> The Paris Agreement</a> was an agreement signed in 2016 under the United Nations to deal with CO2 emissions and address climate change. This agreement is legislation that could impact the future of coral bleaching and slowly reverse the effects of pollution. President Donald Trump announced that he would remove the United States from this agreement, which under contract could only happen in November 2020. Social media users have taken to Twitter to announce their stance on their agreement and pushback in favor of it, in the hopes to stop coral bleaching.
		</li>
				<li> <h2>&#35;OceanAcidification:</h2> <a href = "https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Ocean+Acidification"> OceanAcidification</a> is the concept that as more CO2 and greenhouse gases are trapped in the atmosphere (as a quarter of the gas we emit becomes trapped), the chemistry of the ocean changes also. In this case, the pH of the ocean has dropped, causing it to become more acidic. This harms the creatures within the seas, from the corals to fish, snails, snakes and more.</li>
